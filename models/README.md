## Guidelines for storing models
We recommend teams to utilize MLFlow's artifacts and model registry for storing models, but in case teams do not have a running MLFlow server and IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) integration to save models, teams may temporarily store models in this directory.
We still do recommend that teams set up the MLFlow and COS integration environment with or without the DS Standards support.
