# configs
A directory for storing all configurations for the project.

## Guidelines for subdirectories
By default there will be no subdirectories, but a good starter will be to have subdirectories such as data_builder, model_builder, pipeline_builder, ensemble_builder, MLFlow, Logging, and License Header.

## MUST READ
This directory is for storing configurations that could be shared to the public. Make sure to store credentials for server connections in the "credentials" directory, which is gitignored by default.
