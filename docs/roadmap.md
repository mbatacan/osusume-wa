The project roadmap page serves as a project timeline. We encourage you to update this page regularly so that the team and its users are aware of past releases, upcoming releases, and when project milestones are to expected to be reached. This page is not required, but invites you include the following:

- Projected milestones / roadmap i.e. timelime of past events and expected events (PoC, MVP, releases)
- Potential project risks / unknowns / uncontrollable dependencies that may impact timeline
