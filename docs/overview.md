This is the front page of your project documentation!

The Standards team has designed this documentation template to help you abide by CAO's documentation best practices. On each tab we have outlined the materials we expect each project to have documented, from EDA to end-user outputs. This template is designed to be a living piece of documentation, regularly updated with all new and relevent project information.

This page serves as your project overview, and requires the following documentation information:

- Describe customer business objectives/issues and briefly outline how the project will work to address and solve it
- Define project evaluation metrics
