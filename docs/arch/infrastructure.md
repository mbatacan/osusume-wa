This is page 3 of your project architecture, and serves as your infrastructure documentation -- most similar to a development handbook. This page requires the following documentation information:

- [ ] Computing (e.g., Bluecloud, Cirrus) and storage (e.g., DB2, COS) infrastructure that your data science pipeline runs on within various environments (e.g., experimental, developmental, productional, staging)?
- [ ] Credential and configuration information related to infrastructure requirements, or who maintains access to it

*Infrastructure Table Template:*

| Environment | Computing | Storage |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Experimental |  |  |
| Dev |  |  |
| Staging |  |  |
| Prod |  |  |

Optional:
- Is there specific reasoning behind these infrastructure decisions your team should be aware of?
- User ID and account information (passwords, EAL #, etc.) for  various infrastructure environments
- Configuration and requirements (e.g., memory, GPU)
- Software and versions used
- Description of any API interactions / additional external operations - CI/CD in place 
- How to maintain secrets (if deployed on Cirrus)
