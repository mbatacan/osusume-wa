This is page 2 of your project architecture, and serves as your model documentation. This page requires the following documentation information:

- [ ] For each model in your pipeline describe its type (e.g., random forest, k-means clustering) and the high-level task it performs?
- [ ] Which data are included in model training?

*Model Documentation Template:*

| Model Name | Model Type | High-Level Task | Data Included |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--|

Optional:
- What metrics are used to determine model performance, and why?
- Who are the relevant contacts related to this model?
- If an experiment, describe hypothesis and experimental design
- Algorithms used and why? Any customization and why?
- Are any assumptions made?
- Train/test/validation split
- List of key inputs and outputs
- Linking to relevant MLflow results with carrot
